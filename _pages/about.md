Hello! I am a first year PhD student in the Department of Government at Harvard University. Prior to my studies at Harvard, I earned an M.A. in Politics from New York University in 2024. I completed my undergraduate studies in Economics and Fundamentals: Issues & Texts at the University of Chicago in 2020. 

I study American political institutions with a focus on corporate political activity at the state level. I am particularly interested in understanding how the relationship between business and government affects job creation in U.S. states. I am also interested in U.S. federalism and how the federalist structure affects the distribution of resources across states and voters' representation at the national level. My research is supported by the National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship.

Please feel free to reach out to me at: lstein@g.harvard.edu.
